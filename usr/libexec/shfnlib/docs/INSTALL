Basic Installation
==================

copy the shfnlib dir to /usr/libexec
and simply include the library in your script.

#[l]:functions-1.sh:/usr/libexec/shfnlib/functions-1.sh
. /usr/libexec/shfnlib/functions-1.sh

or
place the shfnlib dir wherever you want and set gl_funcdir to that location
gl_funcdir="/home/username/shfnlib"

#[l]:functions-1.sh:/home/username/shfnlib/functions-1.sh
. ${gl_funcdir}/functions-1.sh


the "base" script functions can be copied directly into your scripts,
  just be careful as some of these have cross dependencies.
